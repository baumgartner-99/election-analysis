## Election Audit Summary
This script provides a few options for other election audits. For instance, the code could be modified to check for potential voter fraud, such as duplicate Ballot ID numbers. Additionally, code could be added to hone in on how each candidate did with respect to each county - it would be useful for candidates to know which counties they won the most votes in.
